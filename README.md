Pen Stand.stl - This is a modern pen stand made in Fusion 360. The sphere is the base of the stand and the cylinders around it are the ones holding the pens, pencils, etc. There are also supports for the cylinders so they don't break and the center of the sphere has a small space to hold items like USB drives. Finally, all the edges have been chamfered so that the object does not hurt while using it.
